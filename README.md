# Weather EDA - Nashik

## Project Overview

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of historical weather data from Nashik. The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in weather parameters, including temperature, humidity, and more. Key findings include identifying the hottest months and a noticeable rise in temperature since the year 2000.

## Dataset

### About the Dataset

This dataset contains historical weather data for Nashik, with the following features:

- **Temperature:** The degree of heat present in the atmosphere.
- **Humidity:** The amount of moisture in the air.
- **Dew Point:** The temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture.
- **Precipitation:** The amount of rainfall or other forms of precipitation.
- **Pressure:** The atmospheric pressure in the area.
- **Cloud Cover:** The fraction of the sky covered by clouds.
- **Vapor Pressure Deficit:** The difference between the amount of moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when saturated.
- **Wind Speed:** The speed of wind in the area.
- **Wind Direction:** The direction from which the wind is blowing.

### Key Findings

- **Hottest Months:** April and May observer the highest temperatue of Nashik
- **Most Rainy Season:** July Observes the most rainfall
- **Temperature Trends:** Observed a significant rise in average temperatures since the year 2000.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Data Visualization:** Using graphs and plots to visualize trends and patterns.
3. **Trend Analysis:** Identifying long-term trends in temperature and other weather parameters.
4. **Seasonal Patterns:** Exploring seasonal variations in the weather data.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA.

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the weather patterns of Nashik, helping to understand the impact of climate change over the years. The findings can be used for further research and decision-making.
